# Overview

Pylomap is a program which creates data visualisations for QIIME2 BIOM microorganism data. It allows you to :

- Produce a heat map to show and compare the relative abundance of microbes in your samples. 
- Generate a dendrogram showing which of your samples are most alike in microbial composition. 
- Show which pathways are associated with the microbes present in your samples.
- Create LaTex tables showing the names and descriptions of your chosen pathways. 
- Group microbes by taxon, such as phylum or classification, to give a broader overview of the data.
